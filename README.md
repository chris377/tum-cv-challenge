#Application "Tour-Into-The-Picture" Manual

Step 1: Please open the application, select a picture by clicking the button 'choose image', the picture can be previewed in the middle. 

Step 2: Then please select whether you want to skip the step of cutting out the foreground.
a)	If you want to skip, please do not click the button 'choose foreground' and the button 'show picture'.

b)	If you do not want to skip, please firstly click the button 'choose foreground'. Then you can draw the foreground with your mouse. If you think one foreground is not enough, you can click it several times until you think all of the foregrounds are chosen. After that, please click the button 'show picture'. Then the app will show you the picture without the foregrounds.

Step 3: Please create the rectangle.
Please firstly click the button 'choose 4 points', which is the 4 points of the inner rectangular. Please do it with the following order: upper left -> upper right-> down right ->down left. 

Step 4: Please select the vanishing point
Please click the button 'choose vp' and choose the vanishing point on the picture.

Step 5: show the 3D-box
Please click the button 'go'. Now you can adjust the camera position and camera angle according to your needs. You can use the keyboard to control the zoom in and out (zoom out [e] zoom in [q]), to control the camera position([h-k-u-j]) and to control the camera angle([w-s-a-d]).

Step 6: Get picture
    After you adjust camera, enter [b] to get a screenshot. When the screenshot is taken successfully, you can see the pop-up message-window (msg - "Screenshot successfully!‚Äù). At this point you can find an image named "Screenshot" in the folder.
If you are not satisfied with this image, please click "yes" in the pop-up message-window. Adjust the angular and position of camera again and enter [b] again to get a new screenshot.


Errors left:
1. For big pictures it might be slow, solution: reduce the resolution
2. To show the 3D-box directly on the app window will cause some problems, which means, when I try to switch to another picture, the new picture will be shown in the button face of this 3D-Box.
